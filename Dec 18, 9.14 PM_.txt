[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go on Yeah, like when are you supposed to handle the front-end?

[Speaker 2]
so The if you leave that also like I have done the project dashboard front-end. So I will just show you that No, the thing is I have to clean this up that's the thing For now, you can just see whatever I have done So it's connected to the database only and then here it's showing the MAU data for now but Why is the navbar still showing us login when you have already logged in? That I don't know I have to check it So these are the current projects I have created one project, which is this one a sample project and you can just go over here and Write whatever you want and the domain Domains are the domain option.

[Speaker 1]
Whatever is getting is it like what you have defined it manually in the back-end? Yeah Okay, great, that's good if the user wants to get a custom domain That If you want, I can just put an other make a note of it make another option You know another option once he clicks another option.

[Speaker 2]
He has to enter what he wants to quit and whatever he feels Has to become an another domain in the database good so this thing Next we can give the whatever he wants like does he want what is TRL levels?

[Speaker 1]
Okay And then categories

[Speaker 2]
So whatever he wants next to the outcome What does he expect like I expect if I have a weather app then the accuracy of the model should be good And now create the project So the project has been created and it's in the draft Here it's showing the mock data, but let's go to the projects page only Yeah, and all this data is is there in the database what is it named by draft So it's in the draft currently In that there is all a draft active completed archive. So if I click on edit this You can see the change once can see the changes and you can see over here You can activate it.

You can archive it and delete it. So if I click on activate it will Yeah Activating this project will make it visible to the experts and allow them to express their interest. Are you sure you want to proceed?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so if you activate it, what will happen you it will get stored in the database that every other experts also can see this project Yeah If you archive it now, oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I have marked it complete. Uh-huh So no problem.

[Speaker 1]
Like if you archive it what will happen?

[Speaker 2]
Let let me So one project is now completed now second project Let me activate it and leave it just like that and then let's go to back to the project page You can see that it's active. Oh, yeah, and then I can also Change the details. Oh, yeah, and I will archive it now So now archiving it you can see that it's in there in archive And everything is getting Stored in the SUBA database.

So it's connected over there and then So, have you done the auth wrappers also? Yeah authentication also no?

[Speaker 1]
Auth wrappers.

[Speaker 2]
What did you say?

[Speaker 1]
Like if you're not logged in you can't enter these pages. Those are called auth wrappers Okay, I have to verify them No, I'm just asking if it's done or else it's not done. That's all.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not asking you to do it I don't know if it's done or not. I don't think it's done. It's just a basic verification Is it like have you blindly blindly just accepted the open export You see you told me to work on EPIC 3 and EPIC 4 now, so while I was started with the authentication process But then I see one thing I'll tell it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Aarush, what did you do? Yeah, he told me to add that thing Okay, fine first thing the UI what you created for add project to this thing, it's fine That's very good. The UI the thing while you are adding new features while it's taking the data the UI while it's taking the data and the next page what it's happening.

That's really good. That's fine but I please request you guys what task you have been assigned, please stick to it because We are going on a plan and main reason the main reason why we are not using it If this was the case that the deep tech project which was there in the old trip was a working condition on We are not using it because they have messed up the client side and server side Okay Yeah Let me just clarify.

[Speaker 2]
I had started with the authentication, but when you told me to work on EPIC 3 and EPIC 4 I just switched it. I didn't When did you start working on it? When you had sent me the github link, I just initiated it.

I think it was yesterday Yesterday when I asked you about this thing Now just leave it

[Speaker 1]
No, just see the thing is if you see for example Aarush had some work Now Aarush also didn't get any work because of it The main reason I give EPIC 3 and EPIC 4 to two persons because you can handle the front end You can handle the back end and back end has to be followed in a structure I just show it to you guys like what I mean by the structure. Just see it That is why I just wanted you guys to do whatever you want so that I can Tell you guys like this is the thing what I am expecting Because if you show this code to Suchindra sir tomorrow or something then he'll be first question like What's the difference between old repo and this repo if you're also calling the same thing?

okay, and Morning also if you want I think you would have already started before morning itself Isn't it?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I study a night when did we have a meet before you start only right I Don't remember Like in evening or mostly evening. We had a call on evening now fine.

[Speaker 1]
So this is the structure The front end has an auth context But that auth context what we are the auth context will take the API's From the back end. You have to create an API in the back end such that First of all, I'm trained. I was trying to use drizzle if drizzle is not working I will obviously use the pooling which I've already given to you If you have to show you one thing One second you can see my screen, right?

No, I'll show you one of the auth context what I mean Main thing what I'm trying to tell you guys is I want to separate super base from client I'll tell you the threat also Super base when it runs on a client, it gives some logs Wantedly or unwantedly if you to give some logs, he can access the Content what super base is returning as logs And by client side, I mean that it will be visible and I don't want any back-end operations to be running on the client side

[Speaker 2]
Okay, you mean the There was some policies like

[Speaker 1]
I'm not talking about policies The super base you directly used in you directly or just to open up what I'll tell you

[Speaker 2]
super base website

[Speaker 1]
code code I Please suggest you use co-pilot use whatever area you want, but please don't blindly click on accept Your your agents will directly edit your code, but don't blindly click on accept.

Yeah By seeing the project I am feeling that you have clicked on accept while I blindly Yeah, I just crawled down Yeah, one second. What's it? See this subscribe super based on I'm done Come down.

Yeah, very cool. It's got a super base from all these operations are to be done using a piece Without a piece. You can't scale an application Okay And All context you use it so that it will be helpful for others or other pages also So your all context have you integrated with other apps other pages?

No, I don't think so The answer is yes or no, if you don't think so that means you're blindly just accepted everything I just told you now I have I I was working on the authentication, but I'd left it in the middle Yeah Because I was working on it.

[Speaker 2]
There are some errors in that. I have sent a screenshot of it to others To make the changes. I'm talking about that Now Yeah, yeah that She just I just want to tell you that I have created the project speech.

[Speaker 1]
That's it In the project speech it is taking the session session from the super base So So it's authentic it's authenticated Talking like The main thing what I saw is not what is not perfect once you log in the number should be changed Fine and I Hope if you know you guys are ready for working in good then by tomorrow. Can you complete a litigate?

[Speaker 2]
What You have how many pics have been completed till now according to the backlog I Don't I have to check what I pick some more replicated.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, please check. I think you have this thing right once Once when so you Create Okay, so expert searches experts are just done no no no Okay, it's working fine experts are just whatever it is working it is hard-coded all right It is not back-end integrated main task is back-end integration Okay Fine I wish I wanted to complete the epic 4 by tomorrow morning's call. Can you do it?

Are you connecting the desert or not? Are we still like doing the drilling thing the drizzle I will try for today night If not, I will go I will if I'm not able to do but because there's some problem with the latest drizzle update Shit the latest software Bit of the drizzle has is issuing some problems If it's not working, okay fine. I'm not using drizzle.

We'll not use drizzle Okay, we will try storing the database schema in one place. So that will be useful for future references But we love I will try for some other version controls. I'll do something but Drizzle based schema will not be there.

So don't worry. We'll be using the polar only You want me to like this make separate back-end and front-end folder and the back-end Yeah Basically, that's the thing you just Google what is the typical back-end structure looks like Create a PS create a separate file for writing your schemas Writing your queries then call that queries in one of your files Use a proper structure. There are many type of structures use of one proper structure So if you are tasked by tomorrow is complete that for that for not one for not tools is not required For not one and whatever not you get has done.

I need it in form of API creation I think front-end. This is completely working Can it be in terms of front back in a case Is it is it fine Yeah, okay, so now check it can you complete the front-end for Of I think a big fight a big fight is not there. I guess, right?

[Speaker 2]
It's there is hourly contracting Defined epic six is there. Yeah early contracting and decision additional value logging No, a big six is not that in the excel sheet. It's there.

[Speaker 1]
I guess Excel sheet is there.

[Speaker 2]
I'm asking about the website No, no, no, it's not there. No.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's what I'm telling. So I pick five and a big six It's not there in the website, right? Yeah, so can that be done by tomorrow morning?

No, I'm just giving my own thing. You can give your time. I'm not asking you to do by tomorrow morning.

I'm just asking It's possible if it's not possible, it's not possible. I'm okay with it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Oh, let me just tell you what I was Trying to do right now You saw that the dashboard now Like that dashboard they were mocked data. So I was planning to Create the real data to show the real data over there.

And second thing I was working on the expert expert recommendations Expert recommendation and the third thing which you pointed out the login issue It was showing over there to login Those three things Logging issues still there. I mean like when you logged in you you're seeing that logging button right over there Okay, that one.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, fine. Yeah, okay fix that Fix all that we will see what is the progress by tomorrow morning. Yeah So you guys got a clarity right now, please?

Follow your tasks You will get I if you are really interested in both right in the back end You have to handle both of them But for now, I'm asking you so that the main reason I'm asking you to do only this much is Because we three will come on a same project structure. Then it will be helpful Yeah, I don't I don't want that messy project structure what that old team had done Okay, yes, we'll meet in the morning then please complete this and odd part I Do the APS for other things all part you live it all part. I will try to fix whatever you're done And that you can push the code and get up Whatever right now.

Yeah, whatever you can just push it on part. I'll fix it and I'll be But I was when we'll be recording you'll be coding right now Yeah, right Fine, you know you'll be following one back end structure, right? Yeah, I can't Yeah, they can back in whatever it is, what are such a before and can you bring it to me Not know why you're doing it Okay, because even when while I am fixing the odd part.

I will also follow the same back Okay Fine fine, not you can just push it off right now and you can start working on your thing and Both of you don't push until I tell But no not you get push it and you just start working on it Okay, do you want me to create a separate branch and then?

[Speaker 2]
Push it out.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that would be better do that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah
