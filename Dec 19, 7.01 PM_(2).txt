[Speaker 1]
So, Arush is visible?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay. So, basically, use the soft controller and majorly the role-based access control. So, basically, for admin and for expert, that particular control is needed.

So, that also is there here. You're following me right? If you have any questions, please ask.

I'll explain in detail. I'm assuming that you know this.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Email verification also. We'll see whether we will send the OTP or not.

For now, we'll ignore the email verification part. I will do that later. You just use this auth for now.

Whenever you call this auth middleware, you will get everything which is there in the headers. In the header, the user's data. Whatever is there in the profitable user, user email, user ID, everything will be there.

Okay. Okay. So, if you call this auth, you will get that.

Whichever API you want to use the auth right, use it like this. Server.shares. Yeah. For example, I want to use that data which is there logged in.

So, create an API call like this and pass the auth into that. So, once I pass the auth into that, I can use that directly. For example, get current user.

I will use that request that user.id directly. Hope you understand it. Even for login also.

Request your body. In the body only, I will be passing the email and password. I don't need anything else.

If I need anything like local storage data, just pass the auth. Fine. And one more thing.

I've sent one schema in the group. I wanted it this precise. So, many unwanted things are there.

That much is not. We can't get that also. But email verified also, I need it.

One column. So, if I remove it, there are some tables like profile credentials, profile education, experience, language and all. So, what should we do?

We reset the profile creation part.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there are like too many things. I don't think it's.

[Speaker 1]
Nachiket, what do you tell? Shall we do that? I felt that tables are messy when I was writing the auth.

Nachiket, what do you tell? Hello.

[Speaker 3]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Hi. Nachiket.

[Speaker 2]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, what is the suggestion? Shall I reset it or should we continue with that? I hope you're understanding what I'm telling.

Can you see the screen?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Can you see my database screen?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I can see it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, in the database, if you see here, profile payment, profile language, experience, education, credentials.

[Speaker 2]
I can see only the VS code.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that's what I asked once again. I'll show it. Okay, is visible?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, now the thing is there are so many unwanted things. Here, the useful thing is role, email. I need one more column called email verified.

I will manually send the OTPs using Google Earth or something.

[Speaker 2]
We need to add this one.

[Speaker 1]
Because Superbase confirm user APS will be limited.

[Speaker 2]
We need to add one thing whether he's a buyer or an expert.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that is with role.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, this is, do you test it or is it from me?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no, what I'm telling is I've created the backend. All these APS are directly copy pasted from my previous, most of the APS are copy pasted from my previous projects. And most of the other APS are directly A generated.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's done by me. So, it's currently showing the role as user. We need only two roles.

One is expert or buyer.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there are actually three roles.

[Speaker 2]
What's user for?

[Speaker 1]
Admin, expert and user or buyer, both are same.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
A typical user is a buyer, both are same. Both the roles are same. We can make it as buyer, that was the problem.

Like in the new schema, if you see the WhatsApp.

[Speaker 2]
Make it buyer only.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, in the scheme, fine, it's not a problem. If you want buyer, I'll make it buyer.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You just tell me, my question was not that. My question was, all these profile creation, profile education, profile experience are all the extra information an expert needs only.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
All these data are not required by the user or a buyer. Yeah. So, all these data can be a separate schema for an expert role.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, we can create a schema separately for that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, we'll create these tables again. For now, let us take a copy of these tables and let's reset the table is what I'm thinking. If you feel that is unnecessary, then only thing what we have to do is in the profile tables, everything is there.

I needed majority like the last login and last timestamp. If I need, we can use it a lot of times for usually we have messages, right, chat system. We can use this feature for the timestamp loading.

And one major problem I did is email verified. So, we can either add that one or two columns or we can reset the table. What do you guys suggest?

[Speaker 2]
Reset it, bro.

[Speaker 1]
Both of you are telling reset? Sure? Because a lot of work will be extended then.

[Speaker 2]
Because...

[Speaker 1]
No, there's no problem in resetting. I might be thinking wrong. So, I just want to take third opinion.

[Speaker 2]
I would say reset. Arun, what's your take?

[Speaker 1]
Reset. Okay, sure. Because see, if I have to delete profiles, all the tables connected or foreign key for that profiles will be deleted.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and even do one thing that when I was trying to do this connecting them, the case which you are using, snake case or camel case...

[Speaker 1]
No, I think everything is snake case. Like if you have to make it camel case, you have to change a lot. Let everything be snake case.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and...

[Speaker 1]
When you told that, that day only I checked the database. Like I know camel case is preferred everywhere. It's easy to read also.

But everywhere they use snake case. We can't change every tables right now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, let it be snake case. We'll follow the snake case over the whole project.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And if you notice in my code also, like I have not used a model folder for now. Like it was urgent. For now, use it.

I will fix it later.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, one thing is that, in order to make that flow, currently when I switch to just backend...

[Speaker 1]
You need an auth, right? For every flow. Yeah.

Yeah, that auth, that's what I'm... That's the main reason for the main... I've done that auth.

I've pushed it in the backend.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so it's there in the backend, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I've pushed it in the backend just now. But the main reason is that only. Did you understand the flow, how I told the backend flow, what I explained right now?

[Speaker 2]
Can you please go through it?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I'll just tell again one sec. I have... There's a documentation also.

Based on whatever the APS is there, I think there's a documentation on it. It'll help you, but I'll just go through it once. But one thing is like, this took a lot of time.

So, don't directly change anything directly. If you have to change anything in this authentication structure, just ask us. Because Copilot will change everything.

So, just check one thing before. Because I wrote my own code. I asked Copilot for help.

It changed a lot, and I didn't want that change. And to come back, I took a lot of time. So, basically, this thing...

What you'll be using is mostly the auth middleware. If you use this middleware, auth middleware, you will get the local storage access. Like, whatever is stored in the header, that you can get it.

Basically, the user and user ID. Like, you'll be having a... Once you log in, once the user is logged in, in form of JWT, in form of tokens, all the details of that user will be stored.

Fine? That one, I'll decode it, and that user will be returned using this auth. This is clear?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, if you want to use this auth, how you have to use it means... Whichever route you want to use... For example, I wanted to use it in my logout route.

Like, the user logout. So, I want to get which user is logged in, first of all. So, just route, pass the middleware, and your controller.

If you go to the controller, I can directly use requestuser.id. Okay. And one more thing I will show you, just if you don't get confused. Every login user, the token will be stored in form of user.

I'll show it to you once again. Where is it? See.

This is what I will be sending as data. User, user ID, email, first name, last name, and role. This is what will be there in the token.

Yeah. Okay?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's fine, right? Do you guys have any doubts till now?

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Fine. Another major thing if you want to use is role-based access control. If you explore this, you will understand.

And one more thing you will use is... Yeah. Well, let's focus on this pool-based query rating only.

If you feel that super-based syntaxes are easier, I have set up the super-based direct access also. It's your wish. Okay?

This is just an author for decoding token, and this is just whatever I've done for verifying the token or decoding token or generating tokens. The tokens will be generated based on the user ID, email, and role. Fine?

Yeah. And if you just want how to use it, you say one example is given as a top. Don't use this code.

This is just an example. If you want how to use an auth and all, and just implementation and auth setup also when this thing is there. And just reset the database with this table.

It will ask you to delete on Cascade. It will delete every table in this profile. Speaking about the login, just one disclaimer.

Speaking about login API and the auth middleware, only this I have manually written from my code. Others are half of it are AI-generated. If some errors you face, please approach me before changing it because I have understood how it is working.

So if any change is needed, I will change it directly. Is it clear? Yeah.

Because I have tried it out. The structure what it's generated is perfect. And login is perfectly working.

That I am sure because that is my guarantee. Other APIs, if you're feeling issues or if you're not understanding, see, I will give guarantee about role-based access control part, the JWT generation, auth-based middleware, and login APIs. Login and sign-up APIs.

Apart from this, whatever APIs you're finding, it's just unwanted APIs or partially generated APIs. If you're using that, if you're facing errors or problems, just approach me once. Because tomorrow until afternoon, I won't be available.

Tomorrow morning, there will be a stand-up call with Santosh that you might have to give a workflow. So if a workflow is available right now, can I see it? If the workflow is ready.

[Speaker 2]
No. Basically, when I was trying to do, even, for example, let me show you when I'm trying to create a project. So earlier it was showing a project was made, created.

But right now, when I'm trying to create a project, it will give a server error or something.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. One thing I'm understanding is your front-end is proper. Everything is proper.

I didn't go through it yesterday properly, but today I was just going through it. It was proper. What extra front-end, whatever you have created, I like that when you're adding the project, know that you will go step by step.

That UI, I liked it. Maintain that UI only for every form-filling. If back-end is not working, APIs, I think everything is created.

You have to just enable the auth in it, right? Yeah. Yeah.

One thing, I have not enabled auth wrappers. Auth wrappers have to do it in the front-end, like using the auth context. Can you guys manage the auth wrappers, or you want me to do it?

Just be frank. If you want me to do it, I'll do it. But I'll be doing it after an hour, tomorrow afternoon.

Fine. Leave the auth wrappers. We'll leave it.

Give the auth wrappers. Is it necessary to regulate?

[Speaker 2]
Because if what we are doing, if auth wrappers are required, then...

[Speaker 1]
No, it's not required. Auth wrappers are just security, like if you have to be on this page, you should be logged in as this and this.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, one more thing, bro. I mean, like, you know, most of the things were created by the AI, CEO. Now it's showing not only authenticated, but before it was showing server error.

[Speaker 1]
That is why I told you, see, I use AI. I know both the benefits and disadvantages of it. So what I'm telling is, literally I've observed you, you are prompting, it is giving a code, you're clicking on accept.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All the time. To be frank, all the time. I've seen your code, I read your code, the way it is there, it is perfect.

It's not like it's not perfect. But it is not perfect for our scenario.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's why I was trying to say that since basically, to be frank, you're trying to rush things and I don't have that much idea in this frontend or backend. During the introduction call only, I told you that I have expertise in AI mill role. So right now, what I'm trying to do is, I'm just trying to rush with the things.

Fine.

[Speaker 1]
In that case, don't touch backend. Because AI is very sensitive in handling backend. Are you comfortable in handling frontend?

Or have you little experience in frontend at least?

[Speaker 2]
Basic experience. But this thing, what we're doing right now, it's somewhat advanced for me. I don't have much idea in that.

if given the time for like to learn things, then that would be beneficial.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
But Shall we add Santosh sir on call?

[Speaker 1]
We'll just tell him the progress now. Like you can tell him this if you want.

[Speaker 2]
Let's show him tomorrow.

[Speaker 1]
He won't be there tomorrow. That's why.

[Speaker 2]
Tomorrow. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Like, let's run a morning call. Like, if you progress, you just tell your progress today. Now.

And, if you're facing these issues, then how will you run it?

[Speaker 2]
Currently, the website is broken. Because, I cannot even login or something. So, I can't show Santosh sir right now what's the progress.

So, but tomorrow, since you've updated the backend, I will just show them tomorrow itself.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. Then what are you gonna do?

[Speaker 2]
How?

[Speaker 1]
How are you gonna fix it? I've kept telling you yesterday not to use AI blindly.

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 1]
How are we gonna fix it is my question, bro.

[Speaker 2]
I will just like, take your phone now and update the backend. One thing was...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, please don't touch backend. Arush, you can handle the backend integration, right? Whatever APIs I've given.

Only till tomorrow I want you to handle it. Afterwards, I will do the integration stuff. If I...

Tomorrow I have a conference. After my conference, I can sit and do whatever integrations you want me to do. Only till tomorrow, I want your integration help.

And, Nachiket, what are you gonna do about the frontend fixing part? Sit with Arush. He will integrate the backend.

[Speaker 2]
I've sent him the GitHub link of this. Sorry, the repo. He has it.

I've talked with him. He's... When I talked with him, he told that there was authentication issues.

So, it couldn't proceed. So...

[Speaker 1]
No, the thing is, why did you use Auth?

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Why did you even implement Auth, is the question. This is the reason I've been telling you, don't touch Auth.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I didn't touch it, bro. After yesterday's... Really, I touched it?

[Speaker 1]
You didn't touch?

[Speaker 2]
After yesterday's call, I didn't touch it. Before that, you... Before that, when you had sent me initially, that...

You're going again about this only.

[Speaker 1]
See, I'll be frank. Santosh sir has given a deadline of 2 weeks.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So, 2... So, 2 weeks...

So, how many days have passed right now?

[Speaker 1]
It's almost 1 week. Like, we started it day before yesterday. So, already 3 days are over.

Another 3 days are left. We have 1 week, 3 days left. Assuming you won't use the Sunday, Saturday and Sundays, we have 1 week left.

[Speaker 2]
Saturday, Sunday, I can do some part.

[Speaker 1]
If you use it, you have 1 and a half week left.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Saturday, Sunday, I can do some part. Basically, I will just like... learn what's going on.

[Speaker 1]
Guys, okay, fine. One disclaimer. Harsh, all the APIs, other things, whatever I've created, it's in a working state if you integrate by Auth.

Is it... Can you confirm this?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Are you 100% sure? Yeah, because in the Auth, same thing only I've given. I just have to change the...

Okay, you have to add the Auth in it, then it's perfect, right? Yeah. Fine.

Now, one thing, I'm telling this strictly, no more API creations. Okay. Whatever front-end we have right now, I think with all the APIs which Harsh has created, I've gone through it, 3-4 epics are possible with those APIs.

Am I right or wrong?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And it's even...

[Speaker 1]
I think till 5 also, it's possible, I think, with all the APIs which Harsh has created.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, if... I told him... Till 6 also.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, 6 also, yeah. So, till 6 APIs are created. Now, front-end is completely broken.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, bro, I told that it's not completely broken, it's like... there were some issues in...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, fine, let's assume it's completely broken for one minute. Like, I'll just tell a plan. If it's not broken, it's well and good.

Now, what we have to do is... Now, you know, like, at least, after using AI also, but at least you know what is there, right? Yeah, yeah.

Huh?

[Speaker 2]
So, what I'm trying to say is that the front-end is there because in the morning's call, you could see that everything was working, but then the issue was that the client side was accessing the database. So, after that, when I removed the client side access...

[Speaker 1]
No, I got your point. You tried to clean what I told, but that backfired. So, I actually got where it's a problem also.

What I'm telling is...

[Speaker 2]
So, the thing is that the back-end team needs to do that to integrate the API to that.

[Speaker 1]
I know back-end team has to do that. That's why I didn't tell you to do. You are the one who put your hand in it and it's messed up.

Did I ever give you a task of back-end? You tell me frankly.

[Speaker 2]
Dude, not to be rude, I'm just telling that two days... from two days, we have been doing this project for three days. So, for two days, I haven't touched anything in the back-end.

And, since you are just like telling me that I have touched the back-end, I have not touched the back-end only. From... Dude, when the start...

when you had sent me this GitHub, only then I had touched the authentication. Why are you trying to tell me this?

[Speaker 1]
Fine, let's forget everything what happened. Let's do a start now. Sorry if you heard.

What I'm trying to tell is can you at least identify what and all I just went wrong?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. Since now you have updated this, I will use that also.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. One thing is... One thing what is perfect in your current code is the UI has the front-end states.

That I don't want to change. that should be persistent.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
What is your... What is the problem in current code is initially what happened, your supervis got initiated, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You had tried to remove supervis when I told it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And there, problem happened.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Now, Arush will help you fixing that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Now, instead of clear code, don't go back to previous comments at all. Let's sit on that code only and fix it. What you...

I'll tell you a trick that has helped me all the time. Wherever you find supervis, just delete it. Completely delete it.

Like, not the file, the supervis inputs.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Then run it. You'll get errors. One by one, wherever the errors are, go to that file.

If you're getting errors after removing supervis, that means you've used the backend there. Now, after going to that file, Arush has the list of all the APIs. Then Arush will implement or help you implement or you both will work together if possible if you're working on a meet.

It will be more than helpful if you're working on that. If not, also, take Arush help in identifying the APIs, or tell Arush that this is the place where it's needed, then either of you can put the APIs there and fix that page alone. We'll go page by page.

Then, follow the errors. Wherever errors are there, the backend help is needed. So, that pages, fix the database, remove the database part, and fix it with the API.

By this, the workflow should be proper. Will this work?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Take the time. Tomorrow stand-up call also, tell the same thing. Every workflow is created.

Every APIs are created. Until week seven, right, Arush, if I'm not wrong? Week six or week seven?

Week six. Okay. So, tell Santosh that until week six backlog, be clear.

Until week six backlog, everything, all the API creation, authentication, API creation, everything is done. Don't tell him that the app is broken. Don't tell app is broken.

If you ask you the workflow, tell that there are issues with integrating the API. Me and Arush have completed the API creation. You and Arush will be completely working on integrating and fixing the workflow today.

That's what we'll be telling him tomorrow. Please don't tell him that you're getting errors and app is broken. Don't tell anything about the errors also.

If anything is there, we'll speak it. If you're not able to fix it, we'll speak, but don't tell Arush that. I don't want him to point out at you also, at me also.

So, if this is fine, I think we can end the meeting. If everything is clear, but please make a note of whatever I've told. If you want help, if you're still not able to fix it after 12 o'clock also, from 2 o'clock I'm free, just give me a call at 2 o'clock.

If you're not able to fix it, I will help you directly. Okay? If you're going to completely work on it, I will start working on the chats.

If you need help, 2 o'clock I will message you.

[Speaker 2]
2 p.m. or 2 a.m.? 2 p.m. 2 p.m. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, both are fine, right? You will work on it and complete it. Don't create any more ATS, complete the current work flow, that's all.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, guys, thank you, that's all. And, actually, sorry, don't take it into this. The only thing is the previous team had done that messy thing and that previous team was like as if he did some big achievement.

He was telling that this project is so good, this thing, you can't tell about it.

[Speaker 2]
After that, I was forced to... So, it's not even functional, it has long data and most of the things are like blank pages.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so most of the things are like... He has just left it AI generated, it's all been fixed. So, and I was forced at one point of time to fix that only.

I wasted my days fixing it and it was irritating. And when I saw your first code, it was the same as the previous code. That is where I got a little triggered, why are we going into the same bit?

[Speaker 2]
But it feels like you're just trying to rest him. So, I don't have much experience as I told before.

[Speaker 1]
No, I got your point. That is why based on that only, I told you don't go back and forth.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, whatever I told you, don't take it personally. Just, if you need help, ask me, we'll solve it together.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, thank you guys. Bye.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Bye.

### Meeting Insights: Backend Authentication, Database Reset, and Frontend Integration Review

**Date:** December 19, 2025 (based on transcript timestamp)  
**Participants:**  
- Speaker 1 (Project Lead/Technical Coordinator)  
- Speaker 2 (Nachiket – Frontend Developer)  
- Speaker 3 (Arush/Harsh – Backend Developer)  

**Meeting Duration:** Approximately 45-60 minutes (inferred from transcript depth)  
**Objective:** Review backend authentication implementation, address database schema complexities, troubleshoot frontend integration issues, and align on project workflow ahead of a stand-up call with Santosh.

#### Executive Summary
The meeting centered on stabilizing the project's backend authentication system and resolving frontend breakage caused by premature integration attempts. Key progress includes the rollout of a custom auth middleware with JWT token handling and role-based access control (RBAC). However, challenges arose from an overcomplicated database schema and inconsistent use of AI-generated code, leading to a consensus on resetting core tables. The team emphasized collaborative debugging and avoiding blind reliance on AI tools. With roughly one week remaining in the two-week deadline, the focus shifted to rapid integration and workflow documentation for the upcoming stand-up.

#### Key Discussion Points
- **Backend Authentication Setup**:  
  - Custom auth middleware implemented for JWT token decoding, providing access to user data (e.g., ID, email, role) in request headers.  
  - RBAC defined for three roles: Admin, Expert, and Buyer (formerly "User").  
  - Email verification deferred (manual OTP via tools like Google Authenticator); Supabase's built-in confirmation APIs avoided due to rate limits.  
  - APIs (login, signup, logout) manually coded and tested; others partially AI-generated and flagged for review.

- **Database Schema Review**:  
  - Current schema criticized as "messy" with extraneous tables (e.g., profile_education, profile_experience, profile_credentials) irrelevant to Buyer roles.  
  - Proposal to segregate Expert-specific data into a dedicated schema.  
  - Retention of core fields: role, email, email_verified (new column), last_login timestamp for chat features.

- **Frontend Integration Challenges**:  
  - Site breakage attributed to removing Supabase client-side access (per prior instructions) and early auth implementation attempts.  
  - UI elements (e.g., step-by-step project creation forms) praised as strong; state management preserved.  
  - Errors shifted from "server errors" to "not authenticated," indicating partial progress but incomplete API hooking.

- **Project Timeline and Workflow**:  
  - APIs cover 5-6 epics (up to Week 6 backlog); no new API creation advised.  
  - Emphasis on snake_case consistency across code and database (vs. camelCase).  
  - Stand-up preparation: Highlight API completeness and integration progress; downplay breakage.

#### Major Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Reset database tables (e.g., delete profile-related tables on cascade). | Reduces clutter; focuses on minimal viable schema for Buyer/Expert roles. | Streamlines auth and future chat features; requires re-creation of Expert-specific tables. |
| Adopt snake_case universally. | Aligns with existing codebase; easier to maintain than mixed conventions. | Minimal disruption; avoids widespread refactoring. |
| Defer auth wrappers in frontend. | Not critical for core functionality; prioritizes basic login/project flows. | Improves security later; allows immediate focus on API integration. |
| Halt new API development; integrate existing ones. | APIs already sufficient for backlog; prevents scope creep. | Accelerates delivery within deadline. |

#### Action Items
| Assignee | Task | Deadline | Dependencies |

#### Identified Challenges
- **Team Experience Gaps**: Nachiket noted limited expertise in advanced frontend/backend (prefers AI/ML roles), leading to rushed implementations and errors from unvetted AI suggestions.
- **AI Tool Over-Reliance**: AI-generated code introduced inconsistencies (e.g., auth mismatches, server errors); prior team left "messy" artifacts, exacerbating trust issues.
- **Timeline Pressure**: ~50% of two-week deadline elapsed; weekend work optional but encouraged. Risk of incomplete demo for Santosh's stand-up.
- **Integration Friction**: Supabase removal backfired without full API readiness; early auth touches (pre-meeting) caused site-wide breakage.

#### Recommendations
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Mandate pair-programming sessions (e.g., via screen share) for debugging to leverage Arush's backend strengths and mitigate inexperience.
- **Code Governance**: Implement a pre-merge checklist: (1) Manual review of AI outputs, (2) Test auth flows in isolation, (3) Document deviations from snake_case or schema.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prioritize MVP flows (login → project creation → basic chat) for stand-up demo. If integration stalls by 12:00 PM December 20, escalate to full team sync.
- **Long-Term Improvements**: Post-reset, version-control schema migrations (e.g., via Supabase CLI). Schedule knowledge-sharing on auth middleware to build team autonomy.
- **Motivation Boost**: Acknowledge UI wins publicly; frame resets as proactive cleanup rather than setbacks to maintain morale under deadline stress.

This meeting demonstrates proactive issue resolution but underscores the need for structured onboarding and AI guardrails in fast-paced sprints. Follow-up recommended post-stand-up to track progress.

Project Sync / Status Update Summary
Frontend Development Progress

* Authentication Issues: Login functionality broken; auth context not fully integrated, leading to persistent login button visibility and server errors on actions like project creation

* User Interface: Step-by-step form-filling UI for project addition is functional and well-received; maintain current UI structure and frontend states without changes

* Project Creation: Previously working but now throws server errors after removing client-side Supabase access; requires API integration to restore

* Overall Frontend State: Partially broken due to Supabase removal; mock data and basic verification in place, but real data integration pending

* Auth Wrappers: Not yet implemented (optional for security); can defer if needed, as they enforce login/role checks on pages

Backend Architecture Concerns

* Database Schema: Current tables messy with unwanted expert-specific fields (e.g., profile_education, profile_experience, profile_credentials, profile_language); reset recommended to simplify—retain only essentials like role, email, and add email_verified column

* Role-Based Access Control: Implemented for admin, expert, and buyer (user) roles; buyer and user roles merged for simplicity

* Authentication System: Manual implementation complete (login/signup APIs, JWT token generation/decoding); middleware provides user data (ID, email, role) from headers; avoid direct changes—consult before modifications

* API Usage: Most APIs copied from prior projects or AI-generated; enable auth middleware on routes (e.g., logout, get_current_user) for secure access; no new API creations—focus on existing ones covering up to Epic 6

* Database Integration: Client-side Supabase removed to mitigate security risks; all operations now via backend APIs; direct Supabase fallback available if needed, but prioritize pooling queries

* Code Structure: Use snake_case consistently across database and code; no model folder yet (to be added later); avoid blind AI edits to prevent structure breaks

Epic Progress Status

* Epics 1-3: Frontend components ready; backend APIs available but need auth middleware integration and Supabase replacements

* Epic 4: Backend structure pending; Arush to complete integration by tomorrow

* Epic 5 & 6: APIs created and ready for frontend integration (covers hourly contracting and decision/value logging); no implementation yet on website

* Overall: APIs sufficient for Epics 1-6; frontend workflows exist but require fixes for full functionality

Technical Implementation Requirements

* Auth Middleware: Apply to all protected routes (e.g., pass to server/routes for user ID/role access); ignore email verification/OTP for now—manual handling later via external tools

* Database Reset: Copy existing tables, then reset with simplified schema (add email_verified); handle foreign key cascades to delete profile-related tables

* Supabase Replacement: Systematically remove all client-side Supabase imports/calls; replace with API endpoints page-by-page, following error traces

* Token Handling: JWT stores user details (ID, email, first/last name, role); decode via middleware for requests

* Drizzle ORM: Not mentioned; stick to current pooling setup unless issues arise

* Project Structure: Enforce frontend/backend separation; no touching backend without guidance

Action Items
@Nachiket: Identify and fix Supabase remnants in frontend (delete imports, trace errors, replace with API calls page-by-page)
@Nachiket: Integrate auth context fully; resolve login persistence and server errors (collaborate with Arush)
@Nachiket: Maintain UI states; prepare demo for tomorrow's stand-up (focus on workflows, not errors)
@Arush: Assist Nachiket with backend API integrations (provide endpoint list, enable auth middleware where needed)
@Arush: Complete Epic 4 backend structure and share approach for team consistency by tomorrow morning
@Harsh (Team Lead): Reset database schema post-confirmation; handle any auth/API tweaks if errors reported; join at 2 PM if fixes stall
@Team: No new API creations; document changes before AI-assisted edits

Next Steps

* Reset database tables immediately (confirm with team lead)

* Pair Nachiket and Arush on frontend-backend integration today; work page-by-page via meet if possible

* Morning stand-up with Santosh: Report positively—APIs/auth complete up to Epic 6 backlog; integration in progress (avoid mentioning breaks/errors)

## Section 1 (0:00 – 0:30): Initial Check and Introduction to Access Control

The discussion begins with a brief check to confirm whether a participant, Arush, is visible on the call. Once confirmed, Speaker 1 transitions directly into a technical explanation. They outline the core architectural approach being used: a soft controller pattern combined with role-based access control (RBAC). Speaker 1 emphasizes that RBAC is particularly important for differentiating permissions between admin and expert roles. They clarify that this control mechanism is already implemented and ask the participants to interrupt with questions if anything is unclear, while noting that they are assuming a basic level of familiarity with these concepts.

## Section 2 (0:31 – 2:28): Authentication Middleware and Data Flow

Speaker 1 explains the current authentication setup in detail. Email verification via OTP is mentioned, but it is explicitly deferred for later implementation; for now, the team is instructed to proceed without it. The focus is on using the existing authentication middleware.

When this auth middleware is invoked, it extracts and provides all relevant user data from the request headers. This includes user-specific information such as email, user ID, and other identifying details. Speaker 1 explains that any API requiring authentication should simply include this middleware. Once included, the controller can directly access user information, such as `request.user.id`, without needing additional inputs.

For login functionality, only the email and password are required in the request body—nothing else. If client-side data such as local storage values are needed, the auth middleware should be used rather than passing extra parameters. Speaker 1 also mentions that a database schema has been shared earlier and expresses dissatisfaction with it, noting that it contains many unnecessary elements. They highlight the need for an `email_verified` column and begin raising concerns about the complexity of existing profile-related tables such as credentials, education, experience, and languages, suggesting that the profile creation process may need to be rethought.

## Section 3 (2:30 – 3:42): Concerns About Database Schema Complexity

Speaker 3 agrees that there are too many elements in the current schema. Speaker 1 then directly asks Nachiket for input, stating that the tables feel messy, especially while implementing authentication. After some brief confusion about screen visibility, Speaker 1 shares the database view, pointing out multiple tables like profile payment, language, experience, education, and credentials.

Speaker 1 reiterates that many of these fields are unnecessary for the core user model. They identify the truly essential attributes as role and email, with the addition of a required `email_verified` column. They explain that OTPs for verification may be sent manually using an external service, since Supabase’s built-in confirmation APIs are limited.

## Section 4 (3:44 – 4:59): Role Definitions and Clarifications

The team discusses role management. Speaker 2 notes the need to distinguish whether a user is a buyer or an expert. Speaker 1 confirms that this distinction is already handled via the role field. Speaker 2 asks whether the current implementation is being tested or was contributed by them, to which Speaker 1 clarifies that the backend APIs are largely reused from previous projects, with some parts auto-generated.

Speaker 2 observes that the role currently defaults to “user” but states that only two roles are needed: expert and buyer. Speaker 1 clarifies that there are actually three roles—admin, expert, and user—and that “user” and “buyer” are effectively the same. They agree that the role name can be standardized to “buyer” in the new schema to avoid confusion.

## Section 5 (5:08 – 6:15): Separating Expert and Buyer Data

Speaker 1 refocuses the discussion on the main issue: profile-related tables such as education, experience, and credentials are only relevant for experts, not buyers. Therefore, including them in the core profile schema for all users is unnecessary. The proposal is to move all expert-specific information into a separate schema tied only to the expert role.

Speaker 1 suggests either duplicating and restructuring the tables or fully resetting them. They explain that while some fields like last login timestamps could be useful later (for example, in chat systems or message ordering), the absence of an `email_verified` field is a major design flaw. The team is asked to decide whether to add columns incrementally or reset the schema entirely.

Speaker 2 clearly recommends resetting the schema.

## Section 6 (6:16 – 7:34): Decision to Reset and Naming Conventions

Speaker 1 confirms that both participants are in favor of resetting the schema, while noting that this will increase workload. After seeking consensus, the decision to reset is finalized. Speaker 1 explains that deleting profile tables will also remove dependent tables due to foreign key constraints.

Speaker 2 raises a concern about inconsistent naming conventions, specifically snake_case versus camelCase. Speaker 1 responds that the entire database currently uses snake_case and that changing to camelCase would require widespread refactoring. They conclude that snake_case will be used consistently across the entire project.

## Section 7 (7:35 – 8:12): Code Structure and Authentication Priority

Speaker 1 mentions that, due to urgency, they have not yet structured the backend with a proper model folder, but assure the team this will be fixed later. Speaker 2 notes that backend flows require authentication to function correctly. Speaker 1 confirms this and explains that ensuring a robust authentication layer was the primary reason for pushing recent backend changes.

Speaker 1 asks whether the backend flow explanation so far is clear. Speaker 2 requests a walkthrough again.

## Section 8 (8:15 – 10:50): Detailed Explanation of Auth Middleware and JWT

Speaker 1 reiterates the authentication flow, referencing existing documentation that can be consulted later. They caution strongly against making direct changes to the authentication code without discussion, explaining that automated tools like Copilot previously altered core logic in undesirable ways, costing significant time to fix.

They explain that the auth middleware is the central component developers will interact with. It decodes JWT tokens generated at login and exposes the user object, including user ID and other details, via the request object. Once logged in, all essential user information is stored inside the token.

Speaker 1 gives a concrete example using a logout route: by attaching the auth middleware to the route, the controller can directly access `request.user.id` to identify the logged-in user. They also explicitly list the data included in the token—user ID, email, first name, last name, and role—and confirm that this structure is acceptable to the team.

## Section 9 (10:53 – 13:36): Role-Based Access Control and Next Topics

After confirming there are no doubts, Speaker 1 highlights role-based access control as another major concept the team will need to use. They suggest that exploring the existing implementation will make it clearer. They then briefly indicate that the next focus will be on pool-based queries, signaling a transition to another technical topic, though the explanation does not continue within this transcript segment.
